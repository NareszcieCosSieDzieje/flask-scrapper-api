Essentials:
- Finish the rest api in server.
- Work on the docker-compose | it's pretty old
- Restrict the number of packages in TASKS_REQUREMENTS to essentials (it's a copy of requirements for now)
- Finish the tests for dramatiq and the server

Messing_around:
- try tox?
- try doit package?
- install the faker module for testing
- try pre-commit package instead of custom scripts for hooks
- add a grafana dashboard? (prometheus?)
- uninstall dotenv?
